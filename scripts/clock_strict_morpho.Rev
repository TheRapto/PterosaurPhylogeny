#####Excatly the same as the strict clock from exercise 5

####Strict clock model#### 
#rate is constant over time and across all branches

#As rate is unknown, a exponential prior is used.
branch_rates ~ dnExponential(10.0)

moves.append( mvScale(branch_rates, lambda = 0.5, tune = true, weight = 3.0) )
